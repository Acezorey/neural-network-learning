# neural-network-learning

A self-made machine learning model with all of its math and learning algorithms made from scratch using only NumPy

Made via following the Neural Networks from Scratch book

For the purpose of self-teaching and learning the concepts and mechanisms behind machine learning as well as how to build a machine learning model
